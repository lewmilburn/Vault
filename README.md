## Project Vision
The product is for security-conscious users who are worried about the possibility of a breach in a password management system they do not control, such events like this have happened in the past such as LastPassâ€™s breach in. The Vault product is a free and easy to use password manager/vault that can be self-hosted on a web server or ran on a local machine to store and view passwords. The system can be run on a webserver or a local machine offline to help mitigate against attacks, which have become more common against major password management companies.

The project will be developed in two parts, a JavaScript-based offline/syncable application and a PHP-JavaScript web-based application for users who prefer to use the cloud.
